This is less a singular project of its own and more just a place to put smaller singular scripts and playthings.

### TechShareCalc.py
TechShareCalc was a one-off script written to ease the strain of figuring out a math heavy rule for a homebrewed nation roleplaying game between me and my friends.
It asks you for your current 'techbase', and the names and tech bases of your trading partners. Based on that, it gives you a value which was supposed to be applied in another part of the rules for doing research.
